# Quoter

**Use at your own risk. This is purely experimental right now.**

## What is Quoter?

Just a placeholder name for now. Plans are to make to help writing and creating quotes easier. There are a few SaSS apps out there to help create quotes however, what I personally feel, are overpriced.

They offer very little flexibility in terms of customisation.

## What are my plans?

Not sure how far I'll progress with this. Currently have a clean installation of Laravel at the ready. Not sure I want to create an interface for this, though.

Adding some Markdown files and creating a PDF for a quote straight away would be all that needs to happen, using something like [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) would be great to use, however need to create PDF versions instead.

## Ideas

[] Default template
[] Customiseable templates (cover, header, footer etc.) using blade and front end framework of choice (tailwind default)
[] Make use of variables where possible (like Jigsaw's [site variables](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/site-variables/))
[] Output to default to PDF, HTML output would also be great if you wanted to upload it somewhere (for whatever reason - not sure yet)
[] Offer functionality to offload HTML version to Netlify?
